# GitHub Setup Guide for Flash Loan dApp

This guide will help you upload the Flash Loan dApp project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- The `flash-loan-dapp.zip` file containing the complete project

## Step 1: Extract the Project
Extract the `flash-loan-dapp.zip` file to a location on your computer.

```bash
unzip flash-loan-dapp.zip
cd new_app
```

## Step 2: Create a New GitHub Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "flash-loan-dapp")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Push the Project to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions for pushing an existing repository. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd path/to/extracted/new_app

# If Git is not already initialized (it should be)
# git init

# Configure Git with your credentials
git config user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flash-loan-dapp.git

# Push the project to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 4: Verify the Repository
1. Go to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository
2. Ensure all files have been uploaded correctly
3. Check that the directory structure matches the expected structure

## Step 5: Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to showcase the frontend of your dApp:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually "master" or "main")
4. Choose the "/docs" folder if you have one, or "root" if not
5. Click "Save"

Your dApp frontend will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/flash-loan-dapp/`

## Next Steps
After successfully uploading your project to GitHub, you can:

1. Add collaborators to your repository
2. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Create issues for tracking bugs and features
4. Create a project board for managing development tasks
5. Deploy your dApp to a testnet using the provided deployment scripts

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the GitHub setup:

1. **Authentication Issues**: Make sure you have the correct permissions for the repository
2. **Large File Issues**: If any files are too large for GitHub, consider using Git LFS
3. **Push Rejected**: If your push is rejected, try pulling first with `git pull --rebase origin master`
